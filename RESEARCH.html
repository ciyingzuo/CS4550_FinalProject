<h1>Project Wiki: Research Topic</h1>
<h2>Option 1: Player stats tracker</h2>
<div>
    <h3>Problem statement:</h3>
    Our goal is to make a web application that can let player view their game stats easily.
    The functionality will include match history, kill and death statics, accuracy, weapon/gear stats.
    In addition we will calculate a overall score and put them on global leader board so people can compare with other
    players

    <h3>Target audience:</h3>
    Game player, development team.
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Solution proposal:</h3>
    We will use a server to retrieve the data first, then we will process and store it on our own server.
    When people search their player ID on web page, we will send the information to our frontend
    and render the information in various ways, eg chart.
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Data source:</h3>
    Data will be retrieve from Trinet. It's public available.
</div>
<h2>Option 2: Online real time chatting software</h2>

    In this project we will make a online chat application. Anyone can register as a member. People can do online chat
    in real time, they can also add other member as friends, or join a group to chat we multiple user at the same time.
    Each user will have their own personal page, where they can upload photos and share it.
    Their friend can view the page and make comment.
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Target audience:</h3>
    Everyone.
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Solution proposal:</h3>
    we will host a database and a server as our backend, database will store user information.
    The server will communicate with frontend and response for a series action like login register send message.
    The front will receive the information from the server and render it.

<h2>Option 3: Food Delivery Service</h2> 
<div>
    <h3>Problem statement:</h3>
    A restaurant wants to be able to efficiently deliver orders to its consumers through on time service as 
    well as saving money on gas by taking the shortest route between deliveries.
</div>   
<div>
    <h3>Target audience:</h3>
    The target audience for this application would be the restaurant taking delivery orders such as the manager 
    or the delivery man and consumers waiting for their order to be delivered.
</div>  
<div>
    <h3>Solution proposal:</h3>
    This application would take all the orders to be delivered within a certain time frame and map the quickest or 
    shortest route to make all these deliveries. The consumer could see how many deliveries will be made before his 
    order will be delivered and the path of the delivery man.
    We will host a database and a server as our backend, database will store user information such as addresses.
    The server will communicate with frontend and response for a series action like login register send locations.
    The front will receive the information from the server and render it.
</div>  
<div>
    <h3>Data source:</h3>
    The application would use the Google Maps API as the data source. All the delivery addresses could be inputted 
    into the Google Maps API to find the route and can be used for the tracking purpose as well.
